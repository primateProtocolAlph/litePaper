# Primate Protocol: NFT-Powered Casino Ecosystem

## Introduction

Primate Protocol combines the excitement of gaming with the transformative power of blockchain, creating a unique entertainment ecosystem. Our platform elevates NFTs beyond just digital art, establishing an innovative ecosystem where fairness, transparency, and community prosperity are paramount. We're introducing a new standard where gamers become stakeholders in our project, not just participants.

## The Problem

Traditional online casinos often lack transparency, leaving players questioning the fairness of games and the true distribution of profits. This disconnect between a platform's success and the rewards to its players is what we aim to address.

## Our Solution

Primate Protocol revolutionizes online gaming by integrating NFTs to directly influence game liquidity and ensure fair profit distribution. By purchasing our NFTs, holders become integral to the casino's success, enjoying a transparent and rewarding gaming experience.

## How It Works

- **NFT Sale:** We introduce a collection of unique NFTs, each representing a stake in the casino's profits.
- **Casino Game:** Launching with a flagship game that has a 2 to 4% house edge, combining excitement with fairness.
- **Revenue Sharing:** Profits from the game are distributed back to NFT holders, aligning the platform's success with community rewards.

## Provable Fairness in Gaming

Our commitment to provable fairness ensures every game outcome can be verified for fairness and randomness through cryptographic techniques, building trust and ensuring integrity and transparency in our games.

## Financial Model Explained

The financial model is straightforward:

`Holder Reward = (Individual NFT Holder's Stake / Total NFT Pool Stake) × Daily Game Profits`

- **Individual NFT Holder’s Stake:** The share of the pool represented by an individual NFT.
- **Total NFT Pool Stake:** The collective stake of all NFTs in the pool.
- **Daily Game Profits:** The net profits from the casino game after all payouts.

Example: If the daily game profits are $10,000 and an NFT holder owns 1% of the total NFT pool stake, their daily reward would be $100.

## Long-Term Value

The casino pool is expected to grow over time due to the house edge, increasing the value of NFTs and the rewards for holders. This presents not only immediate earnings but also significant long-term investment potential.
